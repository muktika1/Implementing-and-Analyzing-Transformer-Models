# Implementing-and-Analyzing-Transformer-Models
In this project we will explore different implementations of deep learning models and how they have progressed which in turn leads to better and more accurate results.

If you open the ipynb file, there are 5 parts to this project;
Part 1: A small Literature Review on the development of tranformer models.
Part 2: Implementation of a Simple RNN
Part 3: Implementing an LSTM Model
Part 4: Exploring Attention Mechanisms
Part 5: Building a Transformer Model
